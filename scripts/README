# Description of scripts and tests

One may generate test data for advection, diffusion-reaction, and nonlinear-diffusion using the scripts in generate_test_data. At this time, one should use the link to the external repository to generate test data for Burgers' equation.

The main scripts to run each of the above examples are provided in main_scripts.

If one wishes to see how test accuracy scales with number of training points and number of input functions, please use the bash scripts in scale_tests.
